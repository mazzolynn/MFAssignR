\title{Identifies and separates likely isotopic masses from monoisotopic masses}
\usage{
IsoFiltR(peaks, SN = 0, Carbrat = 60, Sulfrat = 30, Sulferr = 5, Carberr = 5)
}
\arguments{
\item{peaks}{data frame:
The input 2 column data frame containing abundance and peak mass}

\item{SN}{numeric:
Sets the noise cut for the data, peaks below this value will not be evaluated}

\item{Carbrat}{numeric:
Sets the maximum 13C/12C ratio that is allowed for matching, default is 60}

\item{Sulfrat}{numeric:
Sets the maximum 34S/32S ratio that is allowed for matching, default is 30}

\item{Sulferr}{numeric:
Sets the maximum allowed error (ppm) for 34S mass matching, default is 5}

\item{Carberr}{numeric:
Sets the maximum allowed error (ppm) for 13C mass matching, default is 5}
}
\value{
list(Monolist, Isolist):
  Monolist - monoistopic and non-matched masses,
  Isolist - isotopic masses
}
\description{
IsoFiltR separates likely isotopic masses from monoisotopic masses in a
mass list. It can identify likely 13C and 34S isotopic
masses and put them in a separate mass list from the monoisotopic
masses. This should be done prior to formula assignment in order
to lessen the chances of incorrectly assigned formulas, where, for
example a 13C containing CHO formula can be assigned to a
monoistopic CHNOS formula.
}
\details{
The only necessary input is a two column data frame with the abundance in the
first column and the measured ion mass in the second column. This should be the
raw mass list output.

The output of this function is a list of dataframes. Dataframe 1 contains the flagged
monoisotopic masses, and all masses that did not have a matching isotopic mass. The
second dataframe contains the masses flagged as isotopic. These two dataframes should next be run in the
 \code{\link{MFAssignCHO}} or \code{\link{MFAssign}} to assign formulas to the masses.

Note that the classification of isotopic or monoisotopic from this function is not
definitive.
