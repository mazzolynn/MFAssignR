\description{
MFAssign assigns all possible molecular formulae to each
mass in the input file, subject to user constraints on the moles of
C, H, O, N, S, P, sodium (M), C13 (E), S34, N15, Deuterium (D), Cl, F, Cl37, NH4, and Z.
}
\details{
There are user inputs for heteroatoms, adducts, and charge.
The terms for each are Nx, Sx, Px, Ex, S34x, N15x, Dx,
Clx, Fx, Cl37x, Mx, NH4x, and Zx. Basic QA steps are included within the
function. More detail about these QA steps can be seen in the
vignette and user manual attached to this package.
Additionally, an option to remove ambiguous assignments based on choosing
the formula with the fewest number of heteroatoms (Ohno and Ohno, 2013), and
the CH4 vs O replacement nominal mass series (Koch et al., 2007) is included.
Most of these QA parameters can be adjusted from outside the function.

Positive mode odd-electron formula assignment is possible using the POEx
parameter. If set to 1 positive mode odd-electron ionized masses can be
assigned.

The Ox term sets the number of loops performed by the CHOFIT core by defining the
maximum oxygen allowed to be looked for. Three oxygen is equal to one loop due to
the low mass moiety used in CHOFIT (Perdue and Green 2015). The default setting is
30 oxygen, so it is limited to 10 loops. It can be increased if necessary.

The input dataframe should have two columns, the first column should contain the
relative abundance or intensity for the ion mass and the second column should contain
the ion mass, either positive or negative mode. The function can also handle an additional
input dataframe containing the masses identified as istopic by the IsoFiltR function. The
outputs of that function can be directly put into this function as peaks and isopeaks,
doing so will allow likely 13C isotope masses to be match to assigned monoisotopic masses.
The inclusion of an isotopic mass list is not required, however.
