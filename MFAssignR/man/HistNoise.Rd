\title{Estimates the noise level}
\usage{
HistNoise(df, SN = 0, bin = 0.01)
}
\arguments{
\item{df}{- dataframe of intensity and ion mass, column 1 should be mass,
column 2 should be intensity}

\item{SN}{- numeric value for situations where a predefined noise value
is desired, default is 0}

\item{bin}{- numeric value determining the binwidth of the histogram,
default is 0.01}
}
\value{
List containing numeric noise level ("Noise")
and natural log intensity histogram ("Hist")

  Histogram shows where the cut is being applied
}
\description{
For raw mass spectral data using the method
developed by Zhurov et al. Anal. Chem. (2014).
It uses the natural log of the intensity to create a histogram which then
is used to determine the noise level for the data being analyzed.
The data being put into this function should be the raw mass list
output from a mass spectrum, if the noise peaks have been removed
already, it will not work.
}
\details{
The value reported in the console will be the estimated noise level
and the plot will demonstrate where the cut is being applied to the
data. The value in the console can then be multiplied by whatever
value is desired in order to reach the value to be used to cut the data.
